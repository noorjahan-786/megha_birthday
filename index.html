      <p>Friendship isn’t just about spending time together—it’s about understanding, trust, and the lessons we learn from each other.</p>
      <p>From late-night talks about life to laughing so hard we cried, you’ve filled my life with so much joy.</p>
      <p>But our friendship isn’t just about the good times. You’ve been there for me in moments of doubt, lifting me up with your wisdom and unwavering belief in me. You’ve taught me what it means to truly care for someone, to put their happiness and well-being above your own. I’ve learned <span class="highlight">patience, kindness, and strength</span> from you.</p>
      <p>There are no secrets between us; we know each other inside and out. You’re the person I turn to with my dreams, fears, and silly thoughts, knowing you’ll never judge me. And I hope I’ve been the same for you.</p>
      <p>So here’s to you, my dearest Megha—on your special day and every day. You deserve the world, and I hope this year brings you as much happiness as you’ve brought into my life.</p>
      <p class="highlight">Happy Birthday, my closest friend. Thank you for being you.</p>
